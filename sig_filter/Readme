* sig_filter -- program for processing signals recorded by pico_rec program.

Some of filters ptint pnm-file on output. Information about frequency and
time scales are stored in PNM comments. There is a few programs for
working with such files:

* sig_pnmtopng -- a filter program for converting PNM images to PNG.
Saves all PNM comments into "pnmc" chunk.
sig_filter writes some useful information where, we want to keep it.

* sig_pnginfo -- read comments from "pnmc" chunk of a PNG file

* sig_pngfig -- update FIG file for a PNG

* sig_figdat -- extract information form FIG file written by sig_pngfig.
One can add boxes there and get time and freqency ranges.
 - only boxes with depth 50 are extracted
 - output format: <file> <xmin> <xmax> <ymin> <ymax> <name>

testsig_noise  -- create noise signals for tests
testsig_decay  -- create decaying signals for tests
testsig_2decay -- create double decaying signals for tests

wav2sig, sig2wav -- convert SIG-files to WAV and back
