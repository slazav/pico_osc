## spp-picoosc - SPP interface for Picoscope PS4224

### Folders:

* spp-picoosc -- SPP interface for Picoscope 4000 devices. (SPP is a
"simple pipe protocol" used to communicate with command-line programs
via unix pipes. It is used in some of my programs: graphene, device2.
This allows to use the oscilloscopes in the device2 system, but the
communication can be also done with simple shell scripts).

* pico_repack -- scripts for repacking pico libraries from original DEBs
to Altlinux RPMs.

* modules -- I'm using my mapsoft2 build system with local set of modules.
